# Welcome to The 2035 Initiative GitHub Organization!

### Who We Are
The 2035 Initiative is a collaborative effort aimed at driving sustainable development and innovation to address the challenges of the 21st century. Our mission is to pave the way for a brighter future by fostering partnerships, promoting research, and implementing actionable solutions. We collaborate with leading policymakers, scientists, and advocates to identify the biggest barriers to rapid climate progress – and then take those barriers head on.

At the heart of the 2035 Initiative is a commitment to tackling pressing global issues such as climate change, social inequality, and the tranistion to sustainable technology. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement, we seek to create positive and lasting change that make impacts at the community level. Our work is applied, blending policy, political, and technical expertise. As a group, we have a common mission: creating actionable roadmaps to slash climate pollution, protect people, and strengthen community resilience – within the next decade.
